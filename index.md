# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Justin Doan and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    One of the earlier programs that greatly impacted the way I would write programs later on was perhaps Lab 3, part 2. The program was made to calculate the difference between two dates in measurement of days. It was this lab that helped me understand how functions are built and used, such as parameters and function calling. Also, the way the program calculates the date was different than what I expected, which made me start trying to think in terms of how a computer program would solve the issue rather than simply how I have always solved it. 

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a pretty major challenge to accomplish, but that was what made this one very memorable. The goal of the program was to determine whether a car can park at a specific time and date based on the different parking signs assigned to specific streets. The use of operands played a huge role in this program, which meant that issues like order of operations and short circuit evaluations appeared fairly often. This lab had a lot of bugs along the way, which taught me ways to debug those bugs, like checking if a function is being called or seeing if certain parts of the program are not returning the correct values. 

* Lab 12

    I was intrigued on how a program could create images since it felt like a large departure from what we are learning, but Lab 12, part 1 really helped illustrate that process pretty well. This program was meant to generate an animated gif of colors flowing across the screen. It introduced and taught me how to use the GraphicsMagick API in my program, which was surprisingly fun to use perhaps because of how different it was than what I was doing before this lab. I also learned a lot about the compare member function that was used to catch for errors, which was pretty tough to learn without much prior knowledge on how to implement it.
